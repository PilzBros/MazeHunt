# MazeHunt
Like Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire, players are placed into a maze of your own creation. Players have to navigate through twists and turns in hopes to reach the center of the maze first. Whoever reaches the middle first is awarded the MazeHunter sword, and has to hunt down the other players in order to win. Players can choose to run and hide, or team up and try to kill the sword holder.

## Gameplay
